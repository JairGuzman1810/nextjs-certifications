# Vercel Next.js Certifications

Welcome to my repository of Next.js certifications completed through Vercel's official learning platform. This repository showcases the full learning path — from foundational React knowledge to building scalable full-stack applications with Next.js.

## Structure

The repository is organized into four main folders — one for each course. Inside each course folder, you will typically find:

- A folder containing the course project(s), named to reflect the specific project or topic.
- A `/certificate` folder that includes the official course completion certificate in PDF format.

## How to Navigate

Each course folder contains:

- A folder with the course project(s), named according to the project or topic covered. Open this to explore the code, follow the implementations, or run the project locally.
- A `certificate` folder containing the official PDF certificate for that course.

You can navigate to any course directory to view the work completed and verify course completion. The structure is consistent across all four courses, even if the project folder names differ.

## Certificates

All certificates are located in the `/certificate` subfolder within each course. They verify successful completion of the official Next.js learning tracks on [nextjs.org/learn](https://nextjs.org/learn).
